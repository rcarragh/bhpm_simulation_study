For real patients the average treatment length is 339.1501 days
(from SUMMARY.day - total exposure times divided by 14788)

10 cluster average treatment times are derived as follows:

round((rnorm(10, 339, 150)))
557 444 275 499 533 460 312 167 540 287
These are added to CLUSTER.AVERAGE.TIME

To create a simulations:

1. mkdir <sim.dir>
2. Run create.sim_part1.r
3. Edit raise_rates.r as required
4. Run raise_rates.r
5. create.sim_part2.r

Post simulation results:
analysis_clustered.r
